# Force Slack in Browser

Browser tabs are marvelous. They let you save things to read later, they let you read multiple
things simultaneously, we've all known this for [20+ years](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/meet-the-man-who-invented-tabs).

Slack hasn't gotten the memo. When you open an [archive link](https://slackhq.com/advanced-slack-tips-for-geeks)
in your browser, Slack tries to open that link in its desktop app

&mdash;which does not have tabs. We're back to the bad old days of only being able to keep one link
open at a time, and losing your place any time you want to peek at a different link.

Slack doesn't seem terribly interested in fixing this
[for whatever reason](https://twitter.com/enobayram/status/1097382305931452416). Luckily, we can do
it in a [single line of JavaScript](src/app.js).

Now, any time you visit an archive link, you'll be automatically redirected to the message in your
browser.

## Install

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/force-slack-in-browser/gfggogadjpapemlonlgpbofdeefkjakf

If, after you install, your links are correctly opening slack in the browser, but _also_ opening the Slack app,
you need to remove the association between that URL type and the application which you probably previously
clicked "ok" for. To do this, for slack.com, clear your cookies and reset site permissions.

### Local Development

1. Go to <chrome://extensions>
2. Check the "Developer mode" option in the upper right corner
3. Click *Load Unpacked Extension* and select this folder

If you make changes `src/app.js`, you need to reload the extension which you can do by Cmd-R
reloading <chrome://extensions>. Then you need to reload the archive link you're testing.
